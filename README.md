## Usage
As of OpenFLIXR 2.9, the setup script is included!

## Special Thanks
Thanks to OpenFLIXR for being an awesome setup that motivated me to work on this as well as a bunch of other projects.

Thanks to Jeremy for making the guide for how to setup OpenFLIXR when the WebWizard went down that helped me build the original version of this script.

Thanks to [GhostWriters](https://github.com/GhostWriters), specifically their work on [DockSTARTer](https://github.com/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer) and the framework they built for scripts!
